        <p>this is my last internship. During six months I had to work on <a href="https://github.com/AriiPortal" >AriiPortail</a> an open source project. In this project I
        had to edit the <a href="https://github.com/AriiPortal/JIDBundle"> JIDBundle</a>
         and create the <a href="https://github.com/royceda/StatBundle" >StatBundle</a> with some predicitive tools.</p>
        <p> Beside, my second project was a J2EE application which help to manage and to schedule the reboots of machine in the
         datacenter automatically. The application uses SOA web services, Hibernate, Maven etc....
          Moreover, a mathematical model was design to tackle all constraints and objectives of the problems. The solver was ChocoSolver.
